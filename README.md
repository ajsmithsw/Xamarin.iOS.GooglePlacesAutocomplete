# Xamarin.iOS.GooglePlacesAutocomplete

A simple Google Places API autocompleting search view controller for native Xamarin iOS apps. Inspired by the [brilliant Swift example](https://github.com/watsonbox/ios_google_places_autocomplete) created by [Howard Wilson](http://watsonbox.github.com/).

### Status
Solution is currently incomplete. If you wish to contribute, you're very welcome to submit pull requests or get in touch.

### Obtaining API key:
Use the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/) to enable the 'Google Places API Web Service' and create a 'Server' API key credential. In both cases do not use the iOS options.
